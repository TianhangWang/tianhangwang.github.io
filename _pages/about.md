Hi there! Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D student in 
[Robotics & Embodied AI Lab](https://ispc-group.github.io/) led by [Prof.Guang Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kBhIyv4AAAAJ&hl=en) at Tongji University, Shanghai, China. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree of Automotive Engineering at Dalian University of Technology in 2021. My research interests mainly focus on 3D Computer Vision, Collaborative Perception, and Neural Rendering. *Download* **CV** <a href="_pages/resume_Wang.pdf"> here.
